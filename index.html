	 <h1 class="atb">About the Book</h1>
	 <p class="ptb"> Confidence Within is a book that teaches us that Confidence is 
		 first an inside job. It teaches us how to build healthy confidence in ourselves and 
		 develop a healthy self-esteem. The author, Karimot Isiaka showed us how she bounced back 
		 after so many years of living with self-doubt and lack of confidence. She shared some of
		  her experiences like; how she moved from not going a radio station to claim her gift 
		  because she was afraid, to co-hosting two radio shows for about a year. She also shared 
		  about how she moved from not being bold enough to speak in from of her classmates to 
		  speaking and training at various human capital development
		   programs (both online and offline). </p> <br>
